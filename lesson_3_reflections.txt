When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I want to be able to work on different computers or collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might still be working on changes or it's not final yet. Doing pull manually ensures no accidental updating files with inaccurate codes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: copy a repo from others and do whatever without changing the original repo from other people.
clones: copy a repo from others and contribute to it
branches: different set of the same repo project with only part of it changed as needed.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

As a backup in case there's a conflict between the files on the GitHub and the remote branch at local.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Google Doc maybe. It would be easier to edit and look since we don't need to go through the version control steps. However, it would be impossible to do version control and conflict resolve. This is only applicable if we are working on something that doesn't need constant change so we may coordinate our working time and there has to be good communication between team members.
