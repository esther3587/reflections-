What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Curren folder becomes a repository. I need to do it when I want to track changes of my project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an imaginary place to temporary store the files I changed and need to commit later. It allows us to save time without having to commit one file at a time.
